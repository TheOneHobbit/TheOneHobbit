- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt aka @TheOneHobbit!
- 👀 I’m interested in continually learning more around Front-End and Web Development, but also Back-End and server creation/ maintenance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more C# and Python 3. I originally was taught these via a career path found on Codecademy i.e. Full-Stack Engineer certification, however I am going through and refreshing my knowledge and skills in these areas.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, focused on completing projects started and learning/ re-learning skills.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him, They/Them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I currently work in a Pharmaceutical position surrounding Chemotherapy treatment.
